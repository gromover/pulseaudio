/* One source of device class definitions is the Bluetooth specification:
 * https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers-overview/baseband
 *
 * The Bluetooth specification divides device classes to major and minor
 * classes. We don't list every possible Bluetooth minor device class here.
 * Instead, the "computer" and "phone" major classes in Bluetooth are mapped to
 * single "computer" and "phone" classes here. Almost all of the minor classes
 * in the "audio/video" major class in Bluetooth have their own device class
 * here. All other Bluetooth major device classes are categorized as "unknown"
 * (they are not likely to have audio capabilities).
 *
 * Even though this list is heavily based on the Bluetooth specification, this
 * is not intended to be Bluetooth specific in any way. New classes can be
 * freely added if something is missing. */

/* This function produces a string that is suitable to be used as the

 * values, and that list doesn't contain all the device classes that we have
 * available. If the device class can't be converted to one of the listed form
 * factors, this function returns NULL.
 *
 * We possibly could change the documentation of the DEVICE_FORM_FACTOR
 * property, but that would be strictly speaking an ABI break. Also, it's quite
 * nice to have a device class enumeration that isn't exposed to clients,
 * because it allows us to easily tune the enumeration contents without
 * worrying about client compatibility, so I'm not eager to force the device
 * class enumeration to be the same thing as the form factor property, even if
 * they are pretty similar (also note that they may be similar, but definitely
 * not the same thing, because e.g. "tuner" is a valid device class, but not a
 * form factor). */
